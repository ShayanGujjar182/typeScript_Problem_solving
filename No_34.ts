//Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a array, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.

let fvrtpizza : string[] = [
    'Fajita Pizza',
    'Cheese Pizza',
    'Macroni Pizza'
]

for (let i = 0; i < fvrtpizza.length; i++) {
    
    console.log(`i really like to eat ${fvrtpizza[i]}`)
    
}
console.log('------------------------------------')
console.log('I am very foody person who like to eat very much and different kinds of food to try and love to eat..... and in my life pizza in the big part of my taste and i really like pizza and love to eat.')
