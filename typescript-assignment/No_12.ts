//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names1 : string[] = [
    'shayan',
    'amin',
    'ali',
    'rehman',
    'abdullah'
]

console.log(`Hey ${names1[0]}, Are you fine today`)
console.log(`Hey ${names1[1]}, Are you fine today`)
console.log(`Hey ${names1[2]}, Are you fine today`)
console.log(`Hey ${names1[3]}, Are you fine today`)
console.log(`Hey ${names1[4]}, Are you fine today`)
