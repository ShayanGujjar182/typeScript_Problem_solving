//Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

let fvrtanimal : string[] = [
    'Horse',
    'Dog',
    'Grey Parrot'
]

for (let i = 0; i < fvrtanimal.length; i++) {
    console.log(`${fvrtanimal[i]} would be a Great Pet`)
    
}
console.log('---------------------------------')
console.log('These Pets are really loyal to humans if they loved')
